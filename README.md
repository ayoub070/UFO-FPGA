# UFO-FPGA

The UFO-FPGA project is a collaborative effort by students and hobbyists, aimed at promoting and enhancing the excitement of working with Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). 

Our main objective is to develop an FPGA development board that follows the Arduino Uno format, making it easily accessible and familiar to users. The intention behind this project is to foster an open source community where users can contribute and build upon the existing files.

Key Features:
- The board supports communication with the FPGA through UART.
- The FPGA used in this project is the lattice ICE40HX4K, known for its versatility, performance and low power consumption .

Programming Options:
- Users have the flexibility to choose between different programming environments. They can utilize the closed-source ICecube 2 or leverage open source resources like apio (not yet working).

We welcome contributions from anyone interested in joining our mission to inspire students and hobbyists in the world of FPGAs. Feel free to explore the project, experiment with the board, and contribute to its ongoing development.

Please refer to the documentation and resources provided in this repository for detailed instructions on how to get started with the UFO-FPGA project.
